This plugin works best with zend framework 1.11 and was developed by artodeto (artodeto.bazzline.net).

To get things started, create a directory called "Bazzline" in your library directory and copy the files into it.
Also create a file called "bazzline.ini" in your application/configs directory and include the following lines of code.
<code>
; url where to redirect the not logged in user
plugin.auth.loginUrl = '/user/index/login'
; save the called url before redirect to the login url?
plugin.auth.saveUrlBeforeRedirect = 1
; an array with urls that not logged in users can see
plugin.auth.noAuthRequired.0 = '/user/index/login'
plugin.auth.noAuthRequired.1 = '/user/index/logout'
</code>

You have to edit your application.ini with the following lines of code.
<code>
; add namespace to autoloader
Autoloadernamespaces[] = "Bazzline_"
; enable plugin
resources.frontController.plugins.Auth = "Bazzline_Controller_Plugin_Auth"
</code>

You have to adapt the action "logIn" in Auth.php and change "Application_Model_User" and "$user->getIsActive" to your wished way.

Thats it, have fun.
